# Meat Soup

Meat Soup takes the longest the cook, so it can be worth chopping the meat if you're making soup manually. The meat is chopped in the 1 loop design, but removed for 2 loop soup for the sake of space

## 2 Loop Soup
A **slower but more compact** design where the soup loops around twice before finishing cooking, hence "2 loop soup". 2 loop soup designs also forgo the frep station to further shrink the design

    2 grabber, 2 rotating, 1 danger, 1 combiner, 1 portioner, 1 sink, 1 freezer

## 1 Loop Soup
A **faster but larger** designs where the soup is kept on the danger hob (instead of looping) to cook twice before finishing, hence "1 loop soup"
