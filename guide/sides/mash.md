It takes about 1 full minute to make a new pot of mash. So as long as you’re willing to wait for the slow af heated mixer, the first design will have a full mash every morning.

If you’re impatient and want SPEED, the second design will make a new mash in about 20s, but the first pot has to be completely empty
