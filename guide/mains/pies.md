# Pies

Pie Crusts need to be cooked for Apple Pie and Cherry Pie. Cooked pie crusts can still be used for Meat, Mushroom, Vegetable, and Pumpkin Pie to make them cook faster. The total cooking time is shorter if they are just cooked once, but this versatile system can quickly make pie crusts for all the pie variations

The compactor bin will empty faster than the pie crusts burn to make them faster than a safety hob.

## Vegetable Pie

Vegetable Pie takes up a bit more space due to having 2 ingredients instead of 1, but is otherwise the same setup as the other main pies.

Set the smart grabber to cooked vegetable pie otherwise the grabber will pull cooked crusts without filling.
