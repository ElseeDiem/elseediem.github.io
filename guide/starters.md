All 5 soups have a common step of first making broth and leaving empty broth when all soup portions are removed. The empty broth cooks much faster, so it is recommended to store soups in a freezer. This also gives you more pots each day, as the pot stack is refilled to 3 pots while keeping the frozen pot. This also removes the need to add new onion each time.

Designs shown here assume that a freezer already contains a pot of soup.
