# Carrot Soup

Carrot Soup can be sped up by pre-chopping the carrot, but the time saved isn't much longer than the chopping time. As such, the mixer in the 1 loop soup design can be removed without any loss in efficiency. 

## 2 Loop Soup
A **slower but more compact** design where the soup loops around twice before finishing cooking, hence "2 loop soup". 2 loop soup designs also forgo the frep station to further shrink the design

## 1 Loop Soup
A **faster but larger** designs where the soup is kept on the danger hob (instead of looping) to cook twice before finishing, hence "1 loop soup"
