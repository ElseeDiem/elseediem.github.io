# Breakfast

Always portion off a grabber instead of a hob, otherwise the last slice will be toast; it won’t portion, burn everything down and set customers on fire. Okay maybe not that dramatic, but I’m warning you!

The big difference in the 2 designs is cooking speed of bread: 27s on a safety hob, or 10s on a problem hoblem. 10s cook time also happens to be the compactor bin time. So there’s no risk of fire as extra bread is trashed at the same time it cooks.
