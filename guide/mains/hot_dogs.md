# Hot Dogs

Hot Dogs automation looks like Burgers, because theyâ€™re essentially the same. Except long instead of round. Also they have sauce.

Combine the hot dog bun onto the danger hob, and it magically stops burning. Just make sure to set the smart grabber to a hot dog in a bun.

## Ketchup + Mustard

Handy trick: Customers will take food off of conveyors, grabbers, and teleporters that are next to the table (not diagonally). This also works for ketchup, mustard, and soy sauce without moving them from the conveyor/grabber/teleporter.
