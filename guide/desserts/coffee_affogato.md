# Coffee & Affogato

Coffee and Affogato are combined here, because affogato requires coffee without taking much space for the ice-cream.

The first design is for Coffee alone with one coffee machine. Prioritise a second coffee machine blueprint if you're planning to automate it.

The second design is semi-automatic, preparing full coffee mugs, using those for black coffee and affogato.

The last design is fully automatic for both black coffee and affogato, and is useful for auto serving as well.
