# Tomato Soup

Tomato Soup can be cooked faster using tomato slices in lieu of whole tomato, but the time saved from cooking isn't worth the extra space required for automating tomato slices, needing a smart grabber and compactor bin.

## 2 Loop Soup
A **slower but more compact** design where the soup loops around twice before finishing cooking, hence "2 loop soup". 2 loop soup designs also forgo the frep station to further shrink the design

    2 grabber, 3 rotating, 1 conmixer, 1 danger, 2 combiner, 1 portioner, 1 sink, 1 freezer

## 1 Loop Soup
A **faster but larger** designs where the soup is kept on the danger hob (instead of looping) to cook twice before finishing, hence "1 loop soup"
