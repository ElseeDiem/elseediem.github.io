# Corn
Corn cooks a lot faster than bins empty. If you want corn fast, you can include the second bin, but its not necessary here

Some quick maths if you like maths:
1 bin design will start to backup after 6 corn are cooked, 2 bin design will empty bins every 5 seconds, and make a corn every 5.3 so it won’t really back up.

I couldn’t think of a corny joke to put in here. Oh wait…
