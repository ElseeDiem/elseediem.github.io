# Bamboo & Broccoli

You may be wondering where the broccoli designs are when you only see bamboo. Guess what? They’re the same thing. The food is different, but cooked the same. The only difference is Bamboo has 3 portions, Broc has 5.

The first design is smaller and needs a pot in the morning. If you’re lazy like me, the second design will freeze the pot.
