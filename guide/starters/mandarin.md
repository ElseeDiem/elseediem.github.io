# Mandarin Starter

They said mandarin slices couldnâ€™t be automated. I automated them within 2 hours of getting the card. Set the top smart grabber to slices, bottom smart grabber to 2 slices. The extra grabber for 2 slice mandarin means the next mandarin can start portioning 4 slice mandarin. The compactor bin keeps the system moving to make more 2 slice mandarin
