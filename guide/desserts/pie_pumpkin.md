# Pumpkin Pie

Pumpkin Pie only needs cooking once but requires a bin. Due to the faster cooking, this system is as fast as Apple/Cherry Pies using a danger hob, while only using a safety hob for Pumpkin Pies

Neither design needs a smart grabber but can still be used instead of a grabber/rotating grabber. Pumpkin chops faster than pie crusts, and so moves onto the combiner before the pie crust finishes cooking; removing the need for a smart grabber.
