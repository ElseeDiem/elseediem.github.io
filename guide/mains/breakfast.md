# Breakfast

Always portion off a grabber instead of a hob, otherwise the last slice will be toast; it won’t portion, burn everything down and set customers on fire (okay maybe not that dramatic, but I’m warning you!)

The big difference in the 2 designs is cooking speed of bread: 27s on a safety hob, or 10s on a problem hoblem. 10s cook time also happens to be the compactor bin time. So there’s no risk of fire as extra bread is trashed at the same time it cooks.

## Breakfast Beans

~~Fuck Breakfast Beans.~~ Nevermind, you can automate them now. Beans are round and they go round unless you set the smart grabber to an empty pot.

## Breakfast Eggs + Extras

Breakfast Eggs and Breakfast Extras are both crammed together, because they’re almost identical, and they all fit in a small area.
